                                            Lifesteal SMP is a survival multiplayer experience with a twist. Players are able to steal each others health by killing each other. So let's say you join one of our Lifesteal realms for the first time, you'll spawn with 10 hearts just like in vanilla Minecraft. You venture out of spawn into the wild and find another new player that you 1v1 to the death. You kill them, which adds an extra heart to your health permanently, now at 11 hearts. The other player lost a heart, since you stole it from them.
